## About Me

My name is Caleb Pleasant, and I am currently transitioning into a career in Software Engineering after five years of service with the United States Marine Corps. I had a calling to join in 2015 after studying Electrical Engineering at the University of Oklahoma where I first said "Hello World!"

This previous experience allowed me to excel as an Electronics Technician and come to lead a shop of Marines in electronics trouble shooting, repair, and maintenance. After hearing about the Microsoft Software & Systems Academy, I enrolled in January of 2020 and have found software development to be incredibly fascinating and enjoyable.

Becoming a full-stack developer within the .NET framework is my current goal.

## About the Microsoft Software Systems Academy

The Microsoft Software & Systems Academy (MSSA) is an 18-week intensive coding program sponsored by Microsoft for Veterans and transitioning service members.

Primary focus of the MSSA program:

- Database analytics through SQL Server
- Software development with C# and Visual Studio
- ASP.NET and the Model-View-Controller framework to migrate apps into the cloud (Azure)
- Developing Microsoft Azure Solutions
- Design, program, and deploy apps that access organizational databases and provide end users with multimedia and information services
- Frameworks and the hands-on skills needed to position an app as a product and make it available through channels like the Windows App Store
